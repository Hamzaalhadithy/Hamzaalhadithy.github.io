## 📋 Requirements Phase

### 🧠 Requirement Gathering Techniques

We used several user research methods as taught in class:

- **Observation:** We visited local community centers and observed how young people interacted with posters and volunteer boards.
- **Interviews:** We interviewed 5 students (ages 15–23) .

### 👤 User Analysis

- **Target Users:** Teenagers and young adults aged 14–22 who are interested in community service, students looking for volunteer opportunities, and educators promoting civic values.
- **User Characteristics:**
  - Basic tech literacy (used to mobile and desktop browsing)
  - Prefer visual content and short text
  - Some users may have attention span limitations (we designed short, clear content and visual cues)

### 📌 User Needs

- Access to clear and motivating information about community service
- Easy navigation and readability
- Inspiring visuals and quotes
- Simple interface that works on mobile and desktop

### 🎯 User Goals and Tasks

#### Use Case (Scenario):
_A 17-year-old student wants to learn how they can get involved in their community. They visit the site, read the mission, explore the gallery for inspiration, and use the contact section to get in touch._

- **Goals:**
  - Learn about the purpose of the project
  - Get inspired to take action
  - Know how to reach out or contribute
- **Tasks:**
  - Navigate through the Home, Mission, and Gallery sections
  - Identify ways to contribute or participate
  - Understand the message behind the project

### 📌 Psychological and Design Principles Used

#### Four Psychological Principles:
1. **Perception:** Used color contrast and layout to enhance clarity.
2. **Attention:** Visual hierarchy guides user focus to titles, quotes, and buttons.
3. **Memory:** Repetition of key themes (“community,” “together”) helps retention.
4. **Learning:** Simple navigation aids users in learning the structure quickly.

#### Experience Principles:
- **Visibility:** All interactive elements (buttons, links) are clearly visible.
- **Affordance:** Buttons and tabs visually indicate their clickability.
- **Feedback:** Visual changes on hover or click give user confirmation.

## 🎨 Design Phase

### 🔗 Content Diagram Process (4 Steps)

1. **Content Inventory:** Home, About, News,Project Gallery, and Contact sections.
2. **Grouping:** Grouped related content under intuitive sections.
3. **Hierarchy:** Home > Aboutus > Project Gallery / News > Contact.
4. **Navigation:** Clear, horizontal menu accessible from all pages.

### 📐 UI Design Principles Applied

- **Simplicity:** Clean layout, minimal text, visual aids
- **Structure:** Sections are clearly divided and accessible
- **Consistency:** Fonts, colors, and button styles remain uniform
- **Tolerance:** Errors are avoided through minimal forms and clear navigation (no risk of misclicks)

### 🌀 Human–Action Cycle Critique

1. **Goal Formation:** Users want to learn about community involvement
2. **Execution:** Easy to click through sections
3. **Evaluation:** Content is clear, progress is visible (e.g. from ِ About us to contact)

### 🖱 Interaction Style

- **Direct Manipulation:** Clicking links/buttons for navigation
- **Menu-based Interface:** Navigation bar with tabs
- **Browsing:** Users explore content without needing search or form input

### 🧩 Interface Controls

- **Menus:** Top navbar allows switching between sections
- **Buttons:** Used on contact links and image gallery
- **Secondary Windows:** None used; all content is on the main pages for simplicity
- **Graphics:** Used to provide visual inspiration and motivation
